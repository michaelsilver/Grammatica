# [Grammatica](http://grammatica.meteor.com/)

A simple grammar practice website for international languages. Currently beta testing using French.

## Goals

* Give the user full control: mix and match:
  - types of verbs
  - tenses, moods
  - etc.

> A native speaker uses many different grammar formations in their every-day speak, so it makes sense to be able to practice more than one formation at a time. Alternative grammar practice sites like Conjuguemos allow the user to practice only one grammar formation at a time. Grammatica strives to give the user full control, to be able to study one piece at a time, yet practice many grammar formations together.

* Give the user more data/feedback
  - What verbs do I need to work on more?
  - Are there any subject/verb combinations I get wrong more often?

* Integrate with other tools
  - Quizlet
