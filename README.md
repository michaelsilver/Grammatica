# [Grammatica](http://grammatica.meteor.com/)

A simple grammar practice website for international languages. Currently beta testing using French.

## Goals

* Give the user full control: mix and match:
  - types of verbs
  - tenses, moods
  - etc.

> A native speaker uses many different grammar formations in their every-day speak, so it makes sense to practice using many formations at a time, as if speaking natively. Alternative grammar practice sites like Conjuguemos only allow the user to practice one formation at a time. [Grammatica](http://grammatica.meteor.com/) strives to give the user full control: to study one formation at a time, yet review and practice many grammar formations at a time.

* Give the user more data/feedback to answer common questions like:
  - What verbs do I need to work on more?
  - Are there any subject/verb combinations I get wrong more often?

* Integrate with other tools such as [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/)
  - allow users to import and practice with their Quizlet sets
