TODO (brainstorm):

-- Something to indicate that you've gotten it right other than just moving on to another prompt (possibly green text field briefly)

-- Highlighting the text which differs from the correct answer

-- Dropdown menu to choose what kinds of verbs to practice from 

-- ignoring characters other than alpha/alpha special

EASY ADDITIONS:

-- a switch for the option of possibly not needing the subject (maybe even have both options acceptable by default)

-- make sure two consecutive randomized prompts are not the same [DONE]

-- change the prompting algorithm so that all conjugations are statistically even [DONE]
