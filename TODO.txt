SHORT-TERM GOALS:
________________

	-- Add buttons to add accents (to support PC users)
	-- Make dictionaries/verbConjugation.js more consice (using arrays instead of key:value) i.e.

			Instead of 
			'avoir': // these are the actual conjugations
			        {
			            'je'         : 'ai',
			            'tu'         : 'as',
			            'il/elle/on' : 'a',
			            'nous'       : 'avons',
			            'vous'       : 'avez',
			            'ils/elles'  : 'ont',
			        },

			Have

			'avoir' : ['ai', 'as', 'a', 'avons', 'avez', 'ont']

			Note: this will require rewriting some of the client/client.js

	-- Move dictionaries/verbConjugation.js into the server!
	

EASY ADDITIONS (in cue for Short-term):
_______________

	-- a switch for the option of possibly not needing the subject (maybe even have both options acceptable by default)

	-- Something to indicate that you've gotten it right other than just moving on to another prompt (possibly green text field briefly)

	-- Highlighting the text which differs from the correct answer

TECHNICAL LONGER TERM GOALS
___________________________

	-- Add Quizlet support
	-- Add tracking of users/statistics
		Note: this may require adding the option for users to create an account
		* see NetSci presentation for formulas

LINGUISTIC LONGER TERM GOALS
